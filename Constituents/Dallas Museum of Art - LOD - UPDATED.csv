The paper Pratt prominently brandishes in his left hand is his commission from George Washington as captain of the First Regiment of the United States Army. On his Continental Army uniform, he wears a medal indicating membership in the Society of the Cincinnati, a then-elitist group of veterans. The viewer is thus reminded both of Pratt's past and his continuing service to his newly founded country.

Conversely, the structure in the background-the Middletown, Connecticut, town hall-is a compositional reminder of Ralph Earl's own history and artistic loyalties. Although linked with the portraits Earl painted in Connecticut, the motif is borrowed from topographical landscape paintings of British country houses, which Earl discovered while in England from 1778 to 1785 (loyal to the British cause, Earl left America after the end of the Revolution). Furthermore, the somewhat flat effect of the figure of Pratt relates to Earl's rejection of the painterly effects of British portraiture, even while he adopted its background details and full-length format.

His music later influenced both folk singers and rock performers as diverse as Janis Joplin and Pearl Jam.

Dallas native Michael Owen met the elderly musician in New York. As he remembered, ""Leadbelly sat for me one afternoon and I finished the clay model at that time. From that I worked out the stone cutting, only being able to work on it in my spare time. All in all it was about a full month's work, I guess. During the time he was 'sitting' for me (playing his guitar and singing) he played 'Goodnight, Irene,' but at that time the folk music devotees did not consider the tune 'true folk music.' Still it pleased me when it became a popular song. It's too bad Leadbelly couldn't have lived to see himself gain such popularity.""",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/3058187/,Black serpentine ,Overall: 12 x 11 1/2 x 9 1/2 in.

Their graphic work not only looked back to the open, painterly style of Rembrandt and his generation but demonstrated a modern sensibility in the choice of subject matter.

In the 1880s, Whistler's etchings and drypoints tended to be smaller and simpler, with less fine detail and surface tone than his earlier prints.

Their graphic work not only looked back to the open, painterly style of Rembrandt and his generation but demonstrated a modern sensibility in the choice of subject matter.

In the 1880s, Whistler's etchings and drypoints tended to be smaller and simpler, with less fine detail and surface tone than his earlier prints. His prints of this decade are characterized by abbreviated, expressive lines. Whistler's last etchings showcase his command of the medium with richness and variety.",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/3071180/,Etching and drypoint,Image dimensions: 13 3/8 x 6 7/16 in.

He had witnessed flamenco firsthand in the cafes of Seville when he traveled to Spain in 1879, and after returning to Paris he spent three years exploring the subject. In his study of this dancer, her dramatic gesture and swirling, fringed shawl convey her movement. Sargent sketched the basic forms in pencil before deftly applying watercolor washes to give substance to the dancer's body and shawl, and to suggest the murky background.

Sargent painted this subject during the Golden Age of Flamenco (1860-1915), when this improvisational form of gypsy dancing became a popular theatrical spectacle. Flamenco is generally performed by a solo dancer to the accompaniment of a guitarist, singer, and palmero, who provides percussion with handclaps.

Though flamenco is usually associated today with a loud, rhythmic stamping of the heels, when Sargent saw flamenco performed in the late 19th century, it would have been only the male dancers who stamped their feet. Female dancers, such as the one shown here, only brushed their feet across the dance floor; their performance relied instead on the movements of their upper body and emphatic gestures to create drama.",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/3095662/,Watercolor,Overall: 11 13/16 x 7 7/8 in.

Although George Biddle initially visited Charleston in June 1930, making a number of ink sketches that he later developed into oil paintings and lithographs, the title of the lithograph and its 1936 release date suggest that Gershwin’s immensely popular opera influenced the choice of subject.

Biddle, one of the masterminds behind the creation of the Works Progress Administration (WPA), favored regional scenes like Cat Fish Row. Though born in Philadelphia, he had a close connection to Texas, where he spent 1908–09 working as a cowboy. He continued to visit the state often, and in 1940 he settled for a time in San Antonio, where he completed a number of notable drawings, watercolors, and paintings.",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/3102529/,Lithograph ,"Image dimensions: 9 1/2 x 12 in.

This humble state flower of Texas was forever transformed by the brush of San Antonio-born Julian Onderdonk, one of the greatest early Texas artists.

Originally trained by his father, Robert Jenkins Onderdonk, himself an important early Texas painter, Julian Onderdonk studied with William Merritt Chase. Chase stressed the importance of working outdoors and paying close attention to effects of light and shadow. Onderdonk applied these lessons to his native scenery when he returned to Texas around 1909. His enormously popular landscapes spawned a host of imitators after his early death at age forty; however, none of them ever equaled Onderdonk's use of the Texas landscape as a way of investigating the dynamic experience of nature itself.",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/3140450/,Oil on canvas ,"Canvas dimensions: 23 3/8 x 39 3/8 in.

The work belongs to a long tradition in 19th-century art of “exotic” scenes of life in other cultures made for the entertainment of Western audiences. Edwin Lord Weeks exhibited such scenes of Indian life at the Paris Salon throughout the 1880s and 1890s.

Like many other artists of his generation, Weeks left America for France, where he studied in Paris with the famed painters Jean–Léon Gérôme and Léon Bonnat. From them, he absorbed a realist style combined with a strong sense of color. After travels to Spain and North Africa, Weeks journeyed to India in 1882, where he spent three extended stays over the next eleven years.",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/3210866/,Oil on canvas,"Canvas dimensions: 24 1/4 × 36 1/2 in.

In a little more than a decade, John Singleton Copley had parlayed a partial artistic education and his own teenage courage and ambition into a dazzlingly successful style. What clients like the Langdons responded to-and what viewers today can still appreciate-was Copley's miraculous way with the rendering of textures. Under his brush, oil paint became hair, flesh, and fabric, which is readily apparent in this pair of portraits. Copley also liberally borrowed costumes and poses from mezzotint engravings, allowing his clients to emulate the fashionable attire and self-presentation of the motherland.

Copley's self-assurance with materials and close attention to detail, however, contrast vividly with his awkwardness with spatial relationships, seen in particular in the proportions of Woodbury Langdon's right arm or in the difference in scale between Sarah Langdon's head and shoulders. Such difficulties were due to Copley's lack of formal training. While he deplored this as a condition of being in a provincial environment, generations of art historians-and viewers-have found this to be part of the artist's charm.

Copley left Boston on the eve of the Revolution (his father-in-law was the merchant whose shipments were destroyed during the Boston Tea Party). After travel in Italy, he settled in London with his family, where, with encouragement from expatriate artist Benjamin West, his style became ever more refined. At home, the Langdons prospered, eventually having ten children and obtaining high political and judicial offices.",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/3214606/,Oil on canvas,Overall: 49 3/4 x 40 in.

As Mrs. Bellows later wrote, ""I remember the terrific struggle George had with the head. He scraped it out again and again. Finally one day he said 'get up on the model stand and I'll have another try.' I said, 'Well-you had better make it snappy, this dress will not hold out much longer.' That afternoon everything worked together for good-the head just flew on-and the painting was finished."" The Museum also possesses a preparatory drawing by Bellows of the dress itself.

A member of the Eight, or Ashcan school, and best known for his boxing scenes, George Bellows also produced moving portraits, as seen here.

The artists of the Etching Revival sought to renew etching as a form of original artistic expression rather than mere reproduction. Their graphic work not only looked back to the open, painterly style of Rembrandt and his generation but demonstrated a modern sensibility in the choice of subject matter.

Rather, they were undoubtedly family paintings meant to be enjoyed in private. The emphasis on Commodore and Mrs. Hull's appearance, as well as their bust-length compositions and neutral backgrounds, derive from William Dunlap's previous career as a miniaturist, since the small scale of portrait miniatures left little room for fanciful backgrounds.

William Dunlap was not only a portraitist. Much of what we know about early American art comes from his 1834 ""History of the Rise and Progress of the Arts of Design of the United States,"" the first history of American art, written by someone who personally knew most of the subjects.",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/3224422/,Oil on canvas,Overall: 19 x 15 in.

For Hopper, the play of sunlight and shadow across the buildings offered rich formal possibilities, which he exploited in a brilliant blue sky and strong contrast between light and dark.

Perhaps one of the most enigmatic of modern American artists, Hopper created indelible images of the American scene, both urban and rural.

The scene derives a surreal quality from the giant trade signs of a molar and a pair of shears, and the ""false-front"" effect of the central structure.

Durand, a leading figure of the first generation of Hudson River school painters. Given Durand’s reverential and naturalistic portrayal of landscapes over his entire career, and the acknowledged impact he had on the early works of the young painter George Inness, it is possible to understand how this unsigned work was mistaken as a creation by the older artist. Yet, at some unrecorded point prior to 1974, the authorship was questioned and the painting’s status was downgraded to possibly being by Durand—a classification that held fast until August of 2012. 

Because of the questionable authorship, the painting was relegated to storage for many years. Recently, the strength of the composition and its competent execution compelled a curator to embark on a concerted exploration of the work. Through a close comparison of salient factors, including paint application and the execution of details such as foliage and rocks, she eliminated various artists as the potential creator; however, close scrutiny of early works by George Inness yielded the greatest degree of parity in matters of execution. Suddenly, and quite unexpectedly, she spied a delicate and unassuming pen-and-ink drawing with touches of gouache (illustrated below) that contained the key compositional elements of the Dallas work—the most eye-catching being the pointing trapezoidal rock that appears in the center of both drawing and painting.

The discovery of the relationship between the compositional study and the painting allows us a rare opportunity to observe Inness’s artistic process at a period (c. 1850) for which few such pairings exist. Particularly fascinating to observe is the artist’s translation of a vertical compositional study into an expansive horizontal format wherein the key features are fully maintained. Historically, the painting also falls into a period (1848– 51) when the artist combined the vestiges of Durand’s naturalism with the sculptural aspects of Dutch landscape painting. Inness’s painting style changed radically again with his first trip to Europe in 1851. 

Since the title for the painting prior to this discovery ( ""In the Woods"") most likely was not Inness’s, a new title that reflects stylistically those used by him at that period has been assigned— ""Stream in the Mountains"".",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/3285168/,Oil on canvas,"Canvas dimensions: 35 7/8 x 50 3/4 in.

In its title and mood it reflects the shift toward literary and psychologically potent themes in landscape painting toward the end of the 19th century. Shortly after the end of the Civil War, the vogue for the grand landscapes painted by Frederic Edwin Church and Albert Bierstadt gave way to a preference for a more introspective vision of the American land. Literary allusions that viewers would recognize immediately became popular in titles for paintings, reflecting that generation’s emphasis on the written word. Bricher was an avid reader, and for “Time and Tide “he drew on a line from Sir Walter Scott’s “The Antiquary “of 1816: “Time and tide tarry for no man,” recast in 1843 by Charles Dickens in “Martin Chuzzlewit “to read, “Time and tide will wait for no man, saith the adage, but all men have to wait for time and tide.”",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/3289029/,Oil on canvas,"Sight dimensions: 25 1/4 x 50 in.

Murphy was a member of the Lost Generation, the group of artistically minded Americans who colonized Paris between the two world wars. His exposure to modern art at gallery exhibitions-and subsequent friendships with Pablo Picasso, Fernand Léger, and Igor Stravinsky-convinced him to become a painter himself.

The stark, severe gaze and simplified forms evoke the same dignity and forthrightness of works by a fellow regionalist, Iowa-based Grant Wood. The painting also reflects the vivid-even harsh-realism of broader influences such as the German New Objectivity of the earlier 20th century.

The impact of Jerry Bywaters upon the Dallas art world is almost impossible to describe briefly. He was a founding member of the Lone Star Printmakers; an editor of Southwestern Arts; a professor at his alma mater, Southern Methodist University; and director of the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts for twenty-one years. Bywaters made, encouraged, acquired, and influenced much of the art that defined the city.

Grey, Blue, and Black—Pink Circle is the culmination of O’Keeffe’s Special series, a body of abstract drawings and paintings that she made during the 1920s. She created these works outside the influence of the New York mainstream and before her initial contact with the works of Wassily Kandinsky, whose treatise On the Spiritual in Art had a measurable impact on her later abstract style.

The nodes in the center of the painting recall the headdress of Hopi kachina dancers (and the headdresses of the eponymous kachina dolls); the surrounding whorls of color amplify the suggested motion of the dance and the consonant rhythms of the universe. O’Keeffe’s works in this manner attracted the attention of the painter Lawren Harris, leader of the Group of Seven, Canadian artists who celebrated the spiritualizing energy of the landscape. His arrival in Santa Fe in 1938 sparked a growing movement called the American Transcendental Painting Group, which included Harris, Raymond Jonson, and Emil Bisttram (the latter two are well represented in the Dallas Museum of Art’s collections). Their stated philosophy was to create “a focal point for the development of a type of art vitally rooted in the spiritual need of these times and expressing the most truly creative, fundamental, and permanent impulses emerging from the American continent.” Although she was never a member of the group, O’Keeffe’s early abstractions embody its philosophy. Grey, Blue, and Black—Pink Circle is a prototypical work in this vein, capturing the spiritual essence of the Hopi celebration as a flowing miasma that coalesces into a tunnel of light and color.",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/3339029/,Oil on canvas,Overall: 36 x 48 in.

In a little more than a decade, John Singleton Copley had parlayed a partial artistic education and his own teenage courage and ambition into a dazzlingly successful style. What clients like the Langdons responded to-and what viewers today can still appreciate-was Copley's miraculous way with the rendering of textures. Under his brush, oil paint became hair, flesh, and fabric, which is readily apparent in this pair of portraits. Copley also liberally borrowed costumes and poses from mezzotint engravings, allowing his clients to emulate the fashionable attire and self-presentation of the motherland.

Copley's self-assurance with materials and close attention to detail, however, contrast vividly with his awkwardness with spatial relationships, seen in particular in the proportions of Woodbury Langdon's right arm or in the difference in scale between Sarah Langdon's head and shoulders. Such difficulties were due to Copley's lack of formal training. While he deplored this as a condition of being in a provincial environment, generations of art historians-and viewers-have found this to be part of the artist's charm.

Copley left Boston on the eve of the Revolution (his father-in-law was the merchant whose shipments were destroyed during the Boston Tea Party). After travel in Italy, he settled in London with his family, where, with encouragement from expatriate artist Benjamin West, his style became ever more refined. At home, the Langdons prospered, eventually having ten children and obtaining high political and judicial offices.",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/3342254/,Oil on canvas,Overall: 49 3/4 x 39 3/4 in.

The artists of the Etching Revival sought to renew etching as a form of original artistic expression rather than mere reproduction. Their graphic work not only looked back to the open, painterly style of Rembrandt and his generation but demonstrated a modern sensibility in the choice of subject matter.

In the 1880s, Whistler's etchings and drypoints tended to be smaller and simpler, with less fine detail and surface tone than his earlier prints. His prints of this decade are characterized by abbreviated, expressive lines.

Theus, who had immigrated to South Carolina from Switzerland with his family as a teenager, relied heavily on the use of engravings for his portrait compositions. The placement of the sitter in an oval opening was typical in such prints. The luxurious satin dress Mary Trusler wears was also taken directly from an engraved source, shown by the contrast between its hard-edged, uniformly lit folds and the much more sensitively modeled face of his thirtyish sitter. The elaborate bow on Mary Trusler's lace fichu and the string of pearls around her neck are devices Theus used in many of his portraits to bridge the gap between what was real and what was borrowed from artistic sources-often with his sitters' full compliance.",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/4006006/,Oil on canvas,Overall: 30 x 25 in.

Dove was one of the earliest American artists to commit totally to abstraction, which he did after spending two years in France, where he absorbed both the colors and the increasingly nonrepresentational forms of Paul Cézanne and Henri Matisse. His friendship with photographer and art impresario Alfred Stieglitz resulted in exposure at Stieglitz's influential galleries An American Place and 291, which helped attract young American artists to abstraction.",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/4024975/,Oil on canvas,"Canvas dimensions: 14 1/4 × 10 1/4 in.

In 1841, on his second European tour,Thomas Cole memorialized Petrarch's home in this grandiose canvas, worked up in Rome from sketches done on-site. Once in the studio, he exaggerated the scale of the cliffs in this scene to magnify the drama, and he reconstructed Petrarch's castle, which in actuality lay in ruins.

Although he founded the Hudson River school, the group of loosely affiliated American artists who took inspiration from the natural landscapes outside of the northeastern urban centers, Cole also painted several European scenes such as this one.

Although an American scene, the choice of subject matter and abstract style are due to the influence of European modernism, which Prendergast absorbed through several years' study in Paris, as well as on trips to Italy.

This work dates from the period when Prendergast began to exhibit with the Eight, a group of American artists who were dissatisfied with official juried exhibitions and decided to mount their own independent shows. He also participated in the landmark 1913 Armory Show, the exhibition that first exposed mass American artists and viewers to modernism.

He painted this subject nearly forty times after he first encountered it in 1871 on an illustration commission for ""Scribner's"" magazine. In this late example, nostalgia has informed Moran's memories, creating a landscape that is a blend of fantasy and reality. The shimmering mountain range of Toll Rock rising out of the mist recalls Moran's numerous scenes of Venice and stands in opposition to the often harsh environmental contrasts of the actual American West. And by 1911, when Moran gave the painting its poignant title, the Native American riders advancing into the landscape had long vanished with the dominance of Anglo-American culture after statehood in 1890.",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/4110584/,Oil on canvas,Overall: 30 x 40 in.

In these scenes, Haskell juxtaposes the massive scale of the trees with scrupulous detail, demonstrating his interest in mastering the technical aspects of etching.

Initially a newspaper illustrator and poster designer, Haskell took up etching after meeting the famous artist and etcher James Abbott McNeill Whistler during a trip to Europe. Haskell preferred working in a traditional, naturalistic manner, using the meticulous styles of Albrecht Dürer, Leonardo da Vinci, and other old masters to render American subjects and scenes. He was also interested in modern art, however, and made additional trips abroad in order to study the work of Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, and other contemporary artists first–hand.",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/4125124/,Etching ,Overall: 15 7/8 x 8 15/16 in.

During the 1930s, he taught art in Dallas, and in 1932 he helped found the Dallas Artists League. He was a driving force behind arts advocacy, yet he was one of the few artists of the period who did not work for the WPA. Scorning the Regionalist label, Hogue denied the cheery face of American Scene painting favored by the Federal Arts administrators; more importantly, he refused to ennoble the element of human misery prevalent in so many dust-bowl images. Hogue blamed the region’s problems on man’s inept and thoughtless overcultivation of the land, and viewed the plow as the principal agent of the disaster. In his words, prime grazing lands had been destroyed “first by fence, then by overplowing, now by drought.” Between 1933 and 1936, Hogue worked on a series of six paintings he called his Erosion series, examining variations on this theme.

In ""Drouth Stricken Area,"" one of his Erosion paintings, the formerly verdant landscape has been sculpted into sand dunes by the dry, hot wind. Under a searing hot sky, a starving cow waits numbly for water that will not come; perched on the rickety well, an equally patient buzzard awaits the cow’s inevitable death. The only movement in this arid landscape is the dust massing on the horizon, an ominous portent. Hogue deliberately intensified the conditions in his paintings in order to generate empathy within his viewers for the desert-like condition. He called this approach psychoreality. Similar to Stendahl’s Syndrome (in which viewers overcome by a work of art act out the emotions portrayed in the painting or sculpture), Hogue’s psychoreality was meant to draw attention to the actual conditions in the Midwest. Drawings for the emaciated cow and the windmill, also in the Dallas Museum of Art’s collections, affirm the artist’s careful, deliberate abstraction of each component of the painting. In doing so, Hogue sacrificed naturalistic detail in order to achieve the emotional keynote of the landscape.",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/4134413/,Oil on canvas ,"Canvas dimensions: 30 x 42 1/4 in.

The seductively inviting colors, glowing subterranean light, and glossy, tactile surfaces of the icebergs attract the viewer's eye. Yet in reality, the scene is an inhospitable place filled with danger, as the broken mast in the foreground indicates.

When it was first exhibited at a Civil War fundraising exhibition, critics hailed it as ""the most splendid work of art that has yet been produced in this country."" Both sides of the Atlantic thrilled to this dramatic scene, which was based on sketches made by the artist during a monthlong chartered boat trip in the North Atlantic, off the Canadian coasts of Newfoundland and Labrador.

After its successful exhibition in England, ""The Icebergs"" was purchased by Sir William Edward Watkin, a railroad baron. Its subsequent history is almost as dramatic as the scene it represents: largely forgotten, the painting eventually wound up in the collection of an English school before being triumphantly rediscovered. It broke all American art records at auction in the 1970s, when it was purchased and donated to the Dallas Museum of Art by an anonymous benefactor.",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/4171219/,Oil on canvas,"Image dimensions: 64 1/2 x 112 1/2 in.

Clotho spun the thread of life, Lachesis determined its length, and Atropos cut the cord. One of several versions of the subject begun by Susan MacDowell Eakins around 1881, this sketch may have originally been intended as the design for a theatrical backdrop at the Walnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia. It appears to have been cut down from a larger canvas that contained a nude sketch of a woman, possibly by Thomas Eakins.

Susan MacDowell was already an accomplished exhibiting photographer when she began studying with Thomas Eakins at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1880. She soon became one of his closest students and ultimately his wife in 1884. After her marriage, Eakins devoted more time to defending her often-controversial husband than her artistic career, ultimately crafting his legacy through gifts of art and selective collaboration with early biographers.

In these scenes, Haskell juxtaposes the massive scale of the trees with scrupulous detail, demonstrating his interest in mastering the technical aspects of etching. Initially a newspaper illustrator and poster designer, Haskell took up etching after meeting the famous artist and etcher James Abbott McNeill Whistler during a trip to Europe.

Haskell preferred working in a traditional, naturalistic manner, using the meticulous styles of Albrecht Dürer, Leonardo da Vinci, and other Old Masters to render American subjects and scenes.

The artist explored this theme in several subsequent works throughout his career.

Born in Italy, Joseph Stella moved to New York at age nineteen. Although he initially painted scenes of urban life in a manner similar to that of the Ashcan school artists, he was transformed  by the dynamic abstraction of European modernism, which he encountered on a return trip to Italy in 1910-11.",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/4209965/,Oil on canvas,"Canvas dimensions: 15 3/4 × 9 1/2 in.

Moran was a key figure in the Etching Revival in America, paralleling the efforts of European artists such as Charles Émile Jacque to demonstrate etching’s potential as a medium for creative expression.

This intensely intimate, tightly cropped scene alternates between areas of closely observed naturalism and sketchy, abstracted passages. Cassatt's spatial experimentation, interest in contemporary subject matter, and extraordinary facility with the medium of pastel, led to her being invited to exhibit with the impressionists beginning in 1879.

Cassatt had a tremendous impact upon the development of modern art in both France and America. She tirelessly promoted cutting-edge painting to wealthy American patrons, who made purchases largely on her recommendation. Many of these collections now form the nuclei of the great treasure troves of impressionist art in U.S. museums.",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/4225944/,Pastel on paper ,Overall: 25 1/2 x 20 1/2 in.

A resident of Dallas, Eisenlohr was passionate about depicting local scenery, stating that “if you can’t find a landscape worth painting within ten miles of where you are, no matter where you are, then you shouldn’t be a painter.”

While Eisenlohr championed local subjects, his cultural background and artistic training were unquestionably European. The descendant of German immigrants, Eisenlohr spent a year studying in Switzerland and Germany as an adolescent. He later returned to Germany as an adult, where he studied with artists who had been influenced by the Barbizon school.

""Along the Seine, Winter"" shares its subject matter with Hassam's earlier works, but shows very clearly the first changes in his style toward the mature Impressionism of his works of the 1880s and early 1900s.  The dark clear colors of the Boston paintings are tempered by the pearlescent light of Paris, which Hassam conveys with a much looser, more fluid brush.

Davis exhibited in 1908 with the Eight, the group of painters who broke away from the National Academy of Design to organize their own shows but remained on good terms with the artistic establishment.

In 1886 the brothers joined what would become the North Woods Club in Minerva, New York, which catered to sport hunters and fishermen.  ""Casting in the Falls"" was painted during Homer's summer trip to Minerva in 1889 and is one of nearly thirty watercolors dated to that year.

Homer rarely painted his works on-site, relying instead on rapid pencil sketches and an acute visual memory to guide him in his studio.  For this watercolor the artist places the viewer at the base of the falls, looking upstream at a fisherman in the midst of his cast.  By deliberately rendering the fisherman in broad washes with minimal detail, Homer emphasizes the graceful motion of the cast.  As the fisherman leans back, his body acts as a counterbalance to the rushing cascade, boldly painted in blue.  The reserved white paper is artfully employed in the highlighted foam of the current.  Touches of Homer's signature red in the foreground water and the fisherman's belt contribute to the picture's visual unity.	

Homer helped found the American Water Color Society in 1865, at a time when the medium was considered the province of women and amateurs.  His strong colors and brilliant execution increased the respect accorded the medium, as did his then daring prediction to a friend, ""You will see, in the future I will live by my watercolors.""

The artists of the Etching Revival sought to renew etching as a form of original artistic expression rather than mere reproduction. Their graphic work not only looked back to the open, painterly style of Rembrandt and his generation but demonstrated a modern sensibility in the choice of subject matter.

Although Whistler is best known for his evocative and atmospheric landscapes, his etchings demonstrate the painter’s deftness as a draftsman. Whistler’s ""Portrait of Drouet,"" an etching of the French sculptor Charles Drouet, both reveals the sitter’s artistic personality and masterfully records his appearance, from the hidden eyes to the robust beard. The etching was singled out for praise in 1874 when exhibited at Whistler’s first one-man show at the Flemish Gallery.

Powers Sculp.,Dallas Museum of Art,1992.B.50,"As early as 1852, Rhode Island businessman Marshall Woods requested from Hiram Powers a pair of busts modeled on the classical ideal. For unknown reasons, Powers did not fulfill Woods original request. The client persisted and fourteen years later Powers finally agreed to the commission as long as it was for three statues. The subjects chosen were modeled on the Christian theological virtues of faith, hope, and charity, which derive from the New Testament verse of 1 Corinthians 13:13: “And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.” Acting on the significance given to charity in the biblical framework, Power’s conception of the group had “Faith “and “Hope “as the flanking works and “Charity “elevated at the center of the triad. Each bust was distinguished from the other through both posture and the use of traditional symbols for their character. The original bust of “Faith “was the second of the trio to be completed in the summer of 1866. Here, she wears a tiara bearing the Greek cross, and her skyward gaze implies that her confidence is derived from heaven above.

Recognized today as the most important American sculptor of neoclassical subjects of his time, Powers was also the first sculptor from the United States to achieve international fame, based in great part on the success of his statue the “The GreekSlave”.

His energetic style evokes the informality of a pencil sketch, underscoring lithography’s affinity with drawing. To make a lithograph, an artist draws onto a stone with an oily, ink-receptive crayon or other substance. The stone is then inked, rinsed, and pressed onto a piece of paper.

Brown taught himself lithography while staying in London from 1915 to 1916. Prior to World War I, American artists had to have their lithographs printed in Europe, as American printers were primarily interested in printing commercial images. Brown, by contrast, learned to print for himself, allowing him to produce his own lithographs in the United States. He also printed the designs of other American artists, most notably George Bellows.",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/4264118/,Lithograph ,Image dimensions: 10 x 12 1/2 in.

His detractors claimed he not only took bribes and embezzled money but also dressed in women's clothing—supposedly to symbolize his authority as the Queen's representative.

His use of oversized objects, portrayed with hard-edged clarity, foreshadowed what Davis would continue to achieve later in his career.  Davis developed and expanded upon a unique analysis of the modern idiom. ""Electric Bulb"" is an expression of the American scene, fragmented and recombined as a vividly colored geometric structure.

Between 1916 and 1920, Davis's work underwent a dramatic stylistic change.  He abandoned the expressionistic landscapes and portraits painted in a style reminiscent of Van Gogh in favor of the visual language of cubism, adopting the bold forms and unmodeled planes of color to express the raw energy of postwar America.  In 1923 and 1924, he painted a series of images based on the most common artifacts of modern life--an eggbeater, a saw, and in the Dallas Museum of Art work, a light bulb and its cardboard sleeve.  Davis exaggerated the forms of these industrial objects and colored them brilliantly, creating visual counterparts to the rhythms of the Jazz Age.  These works represent a clean break with traditional still-life painting, exemplifying Davis's comment in 1923 that ""No work of art can be true to nature in the objective sense.  The nearer it approximates the natural appearance of objects the more it is likely to be far away from art.""",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/4286243/,Oil on board,"Sight dimensions: 24 x 18 1/8 in.

The swags of drapery and props in the background appear in many of Jarvis's portraits and are most likely the work of Henry Inman (1801-1846), later a successful genre painter, who was Jarvis's apprentice between 1814 and 1823.

Besides being the leading portraitist in New York City during the early 19th century, Jarvis also worked throughout the South, traveling as far as New Orleans, then the second-largest (and one of the richest) cities in the new United States. He is best known not only for his series of portraits of heroes of the War of 1812 but also for his famously charming and intemperate personality and exploits, immortalized by his friend, painter and art historian William Dunlap in his ""History of the Rise and Progress of the Arts of Design in the United States,"" the first work of American art history.

Rather, they were undoubtedly family paintings meant to be enjoyed in private. The emphasis on Commodore and Mrs. Hull's appearance, as well as their bust-length compositions and neutral backgrounds, derive from William Dunlap's previous career as a miniaturist, since the small scale of portrait miniatures left little room for fanciful backgrounds.

William Dunlap was not only a portraitist. Much of what we know about early American art comes from his 1834 ""History of the Rise and Progress of the Arts of Design of the United States,"" the first history of American art, written by someone who personally knew most of the subjects.",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/4321037/,Oil on canvas,Overall: 19 x 15 in.

The soft forms of the clouds contrast with the straight black lines of the wires, which bend into unusual angles and shapes. Meanwhile, a single tree in the left corner both grounds and disorients us, prompting us to question our actual vantage point in the landscape.

Originally from a small village in what is now Ukraine, Louis Lozowick immigrated to the United States as a child. During the 1920s, he spent several years in Europe, living in Paris and Berlin. Lozowick became closely associated with the Russian constructivists working in Germany, and their emphasis on technology and abstract geometric forms profoundly influenced his work. Beginning in the 1930s, however, Lozowick also began creating landscapes, exploring the interaction between the natural world and human technology.",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/4365156/,Lithograph ,,1892,,American,1,1973,Louis Lozowick,,male,,,,Artist,Sky Overcast,http://files.dma.org/multimedia/images/74113426086141_thumbnail.jpg,Main Image,1

The son of an African Methodist Episcopal minister, Tanner studied with Thomas Eakins at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts before pursuing a career in Paris, where the professional and societal obstacles facing people of color were not as severe as in 19th- and early 20th-century America.

He often set out for walks through his fields with his sketching materials, bringing back ideas for paintings.  Weir's frequent guests at Branchville included fellow artists Childe Hassam, John Twachtman, Theodore Robinson, and Albert Pinkham Ryder.

Much of Weir's early work is figurative and closer in feel to the paintings of tonalist artists like Thomas Dewing than to the work of Hassam and the American Impressionists.  It is primarily in his late works that Weir turned to the landscape for his subject.  ""Ravine near Branchville,"" with its high horizon and broad, painterly touch, can be dated to the final decade of Weir's life.  Pinholes in each corner of the painting suggest Weir had worked ""en plein air,"" tacking the canvas to an easel or other portable support.  Weir's interest was in the play of light and shadow across the ravine, his flickering brushwork mimicking the movement of a light breeze across the leaves and grasses.  As is typical of his late works, the artist confined his palette to shades of blue and green, primarily in pastel tones.  Weir's absorption with the landscape at Branchville may have been his antidote to ever present pressures of official duties related to his participation in two important organizations:  the breakaway Society of American Artists, established in protest of the restrictive guidelines of the National Academy of Design, and The Ten, a group of American impressionist and tonalist painters.

It is one of several works by Charles Sheeler exploring the varieties of industrial, mechanical, and natural power in the United States. In 1938 Fortune magazine commissioned the artist to create a series of photographs and paintings on the theme of power that were published in 1940 as a portfolio in the magazine.

Pennsylvania-born and -trained, Sheeler was influenced by abstract works he saw at the Armory Show in New York in 1913. His mature style is one of hard edges, smooth surfaces, and cool tonalities, in the service of seemingly highly realistic representation. Acclaimed for his paintings exploring the American industrial landscape, Sheeler was also an accomplished photographer.",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/5040900/,Oil on canvas,"Overall: 33 x 26 x 2 in.

He made these intimate private universes in the simple family home in Queens, New York, where from 1929 on, he lived with his family and worked.  Although he had no formal schooling in art, Cornell cultivated a taste for French literature and a lifelong passion for symbolist painters such as Odilon Redon and the poets Charles Baudelaire and Stéphane Mallarmé.  He had contact during the 1930s with the artistic climate in New York, where many of the city's artists and Europe's expatriate artists frequented the few avant-garde galleries.  At the Julien Levy Gallery, Cornell became involved with many painters and writers connected with the surrealist movement in the United States before and during World War II.  In 1937 he was included in the seminal exhibition ""Fantastic Art, Dada, Surrealism"" at New York's Museum of Modern Art.

Throughout his productive career, which included experimentation with film, Cornell investigated motifs such as hotels, constellations, bees, and Renaissance paintings of children.  In the shadow box ""Grand Hôtel de la Boule d'Or,"" letterheads of various hotels and a photographic reproduction of a drawing, ""The Artist's Daughter,"" by Jusepe de Ribera, are collaged on the front of aged, faded blue wood; on the back he collaged pages from a French anthology, ""Oeuvres Diverses.""  With grace and subtlety, Cornell combines the everyday and the extraordinary to evoke a Proustian, dreamlike world devoted to old places and possessions—the remembrance of things past.

Upon regaining his sight, he changed his name to Paul and became a Christian, going on to become one of the major authors of the New Testament.

This painting served as a model for a painted glass window in St. Paul's Church in Birmingham, England. It is the earliest and smallest of two versions of the subject by Benjamin West.

The work was completed in a rented studio, with a hired model wearing picturesque peasant garb intended to evoke the image of a Spanish gypsy. Mora had wanted to paint outdoors, but unrelenting rain that spring kept the artist inside. As he wrote in his diary at one frustrated moment, ""It feels today more like Scotland in October.""

Francis Luis Mora was born in Uruguay to a Spanish father and French mother who had immigrated to South America. When Mora was three, his sculptor father returned the family temporarily to Barcelona, Spain, before permanently settling in New York in 1880. Mora studied at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and the Art Students League in New York with Edmund Charles Tarbell, Frank W. Benson, and William Merritt Chase.

Like all of Moses' paintings, this winter scene is a combination of real locations and buildings from her neighborhood, her memories of childhood, and compositions taken from popular prints by the 19th-century lithographers Currier & Ives.

Although she drew as a child, Moses did not begin making pictures until she was in her 70s, after a long life as a farmer in New York and Virginia. She first worked in fabric, and then moved to paint because it was less difficult for her arthritic hands. Through the promotion of several art dealers trumpeting naïve or folk art as an antidote to abstraction, Moses became an overnight sensation in the 1940s. Until her death at 101, Moses produced more than 1,500 paintings over her twenty-year career.",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/5143735/,Acrylic on board,Overall: 15 x 18 1/2 in.

His spare, brightly colored paintings combine harsh realities and poetic inner vision in depicting black farmers of the South.  ""Portrait of a Farmer's Wife"" was probably painted around 1951, the year a very similar version, now at the Smithsonian, was executed.  Gwathmey's strong outlines and planes of color aptly convey the woman's dignity, particularly in the timeworn face and the gnarled hands resting squarely upon her knees.  At her side, a humble pot of flowers resting on a twig table expresses the search for small beauties in a lifetime of hard work.",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/5153584/,Oil on canvas,"Canvas dimensions: 24 1/4 × 20 1/4 in.

The artists of the Etching Revival sought to renew etching as a form of original artistic expression rather than mere reproduction. Their graphic work not only looked back to the open, painterly style of Rembrandt and his generation but demonstrated a modern sensibility in the choice of subject matter.

Beyond a cluster of shallow boats in the foreground, we see the open waters of the Pool, a section of the Thames that served as the main port of London in the 19th century. The dense cluster of ships' masts in the distance at left suggests the scale of commercial activity along this part of the river. The boatman seated at his oars in the foreground is rendered with quick, nervous lines that are meant to suggest Rembrandt's approach to the medium of etching.",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/5170391/,Etching ,Image dimensions: 5 1/2 x 8 7/16 in.

David Kerr, a justice of the peace in Talbot, Maryland, and member of the Maryland House of Delegates. Like all of Charles Willson Peale's works, this portrait has a linear quality, featuring strongly marked contour lines and a careful delineation of materials-largely due to Peale's self-taught background, which not even two years' study in London with Benjamin West could totally soften.

Born in Maryland but based in Philadelphia for most of his career, Peale was not only one of early America's most successful artists, he also helped engineer the United States' artistic future. Besides founding the nation's two earliest art academies, he trained virtually every member of his family-especially his children, all named after famous European artists-to become painters, as well. At the Peale Museum in Philadelphia's Independence Hall, the artist exhibited natural history specimens, natural and scientific curiosities, and life portraits of the historical and cultural figures who had led to the creation of the United States. Thus, in both the public and private spheres, Peale was one of the leading figures to promote and disseminate culture in the new United States.",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/5170939/,Oil on canvas,Overall: 36 x 27 in.

During the late 19th century, Bierstadt became famous for his images of the American West, to which he journeyed as part of survey expeditions in 1859 and 1863. Based on firsthand experience but completed with a certain amount of tweaking in the studio, Bierstadt's dramatic landscapes thrilled Eastern U.S. and European audiences hungry for depictions of unfamiliar places.

Since its discovery, this portrait has been attributed to different artists.

As he remembered later about the seven a.m. appointment with the president,""I was up before daylight and putting everything in the best condition for the sitting with which I was to be honored, but before the hour arrived became so agitated that I could scarcely mix my colors.""

In 1823, long after Washington's death and in response to the enduring popularity of Gilbert Stuart's portrait of the president, Peale revised his original portrait into the present composition, which exists in over seventy examples. Peale idealized Washington's features according to fashionable theories of physiognomy, in which facial proportions acted as signs of character or nobility. He also set the bust of the president into a fictive oval opening recalling both antique sculpture and Renaissance and Baroque state portraiture, perhaps angling for display in the neoclassical interiors of the nation's new Capitol Building.",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/5198037/,Oil on canvas,Overall: 31 3/4 x 26 in.

Jonson moved the New Mexico in 1924, where, for the next several decades, he conveyed the sensations engendered by his environment in progressively more abstract form and color, making him something of a ""lone wolf"" among the more representational painters of Taos and Santa Fe.

After several difficult years in New Mexico, Jonson experienced in 1929 a sort of spiritual epiphany which ultimately led him to abandon objective sources for his art.  Beginning in the 1930s, his work became more serial in nature as he explored and improvised on certain themes.  ""Variations on Rhythm P"" is one of 26 canvases based on the alphabet.  The various curvilinear, stepped, and geometric forms play rhythmically on the letter P, establishing a multilayered space which, in fact, is not intended to represent a physical environment, but rather to express a visual equivalent of this interplay of rhythms.",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/5200705/,Oil on canvas,"Canvas dimensions: 33 1/8 × 29 1/8 in.

Raised on a cotton ranch near present-day Mesquite, Texas, Dozier pays tribute to the value of the agricultural product that once sustained the state of Texas until the domination of oil and ranching after World War II. This painting was exhibited at the 1936 Texas Centennial.

After training in Dallas at the Aunspaugh Art School and the Dallas Art Institute, and with Frank Reaugh, Dozier himself taught for years at Southern Methodist University and at the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts (where the legacy left by him and his wife, artist Velma Davis Dozier, provides an annual travel prize to emerging artists as well as acquisition funds for tribal art). An inveterate traveler, his interests and collections encompassed the art of many cultures.

According to family tradition, Chase exclaimed, ""Doesn't she look cozy?"" one day when he saw the infant lying in the corner of a sofa. The nickname stuck within the family and ""Cosy"" became the subject of over a dozen portraits that trace her journey from infancy to adulthood. This example depicts her as a pensive twelve or thirteen year old.

When asked the reason for his frequent use of his daughter as a subject, the artist claimed, ""Why? I don't know. She very much resembles her mother."" In other respects, Cosy resembled her father; trained by him as a painter, she exhibited still lifes and landscapes in New York in the 1940s.",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/5228396/,Oil on canvas,"Canvas dimensions: 37 3/4 × 30 3/4 in.

ORIGINAL STUDY FOR THE
""DAVID CROCKETT"" IN TEXAS
STATE CAPITOL
BY WILLIAM HENRY HUDDLE

",Dallas Museum of Art,1987.47,"This painting is the preparatory work for a large-scale posthumous portrait of Davy Crockett commissioned by the Texas State Legislature for the Capitol at Austin, where it is still on view. It commemorates David Crockett (1786-1836), one of the most famous adventurers in American history. A frontiersman, Tennessee state representative, U.S. congressman, and Indian war veteran, Crockett's legend was already established when he died on March 6, 1836, in the battle for Texas independence at the Alamo in San Antonio.

Virginia-born William Huddle settled in Austin in 1876, after serving in the Confederate army. He is best known for his series of portraits of the governors of Texas and his history painting of the Texas war of independence, many of which are on view in the State Capitol.",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/5236113/,"Oil on paper, mounted on board",Overall: 21 x 13 in.

Williams.""  ""Commodore Trunnion and Jack Hatchway"" was the first canvas shown under Edmonds's name, and was widely considered equal to the work of the great American genre painter, William Sidney Mount.  The scene is taken from an 18th-century English novel by Tobias Smollet, ""The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle,"" in which Jack Hatchway learns from the newspaper that the Commodore's rival, Admiral Bower, has been designated a peer of the realm.  The setting has been moved from the original tavern to the Commodore's workroom, and Edmonds chose the quiet moment just before Jack happens upon the bad news.  The skillfully rendered flagon in its straw casing, the pewter tankard, and the block and tackle reflect Edmonds's admiration for the 17th-century Dutch tradition of still-life and genre painting.",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/5279396/,Oil on canvas,Overall: 25 1/2 x 22 in.

The artists of the Etching Revival sought to renew etching as a form of original artistic expression rather than mere reproduction. Their graphic work not only looked back to the open, painterly style of Rembrandt and his generation but demonstrated a modern sensibility in the choice of subject matter.

In the 1880s, Whistler's etchings and drypoints tended to be smaller and simpler, with less fine detail and surface tone than his earlier prints. His prints of this decade are characterized by abbreviated, expressive lines. Whistler's last etchings showcase his command of the medium with richness and variety.

Whistler maintained that because the etcher's needle was small, the etching should also be small. He also insisted no margin should be left outside the plate mark; after 1880 he trimmed etchings to the plate mark, leaving only a tab for his signature in the form of a butterfly.",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/5292980/,Etching ,Image dimensions: 8 1/4 x 12 1/16 in.

Two years earlier, fresh from studies with Gilbert Stuart in Boston and Sir Thomas Lawrence in London, the young artist had caused a sensation in Philadelphia.

Although a historical figure, by the late 19th century Semiramis had become the stuff of legend: an ambitious woman who seized power through the murder of her husband, before being killed by her own estranged son. This view was popularized through the French philosopher Voltaire's 1784 play and the Italian composer Rossini's 1822 opera, both of which helped inspire William Wetmore Story's composition.

In his portrait of Semiramis, Story combined the monumental scale, idealized features, and classical drapery of European neoclassicism with historically accurate details of hairstyle and jewelry meant to evoke the ancient Near East. Like many 19th-century sculptors, Story made the clay maquette, or model, himself, while a team of trained Italian carvers produced the final marble sculptures under his supervision. Two versions of this statue exist: this example, made for the American collector William Blodgett, and another at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia.

The son of a Supreme Court justice, William Wetmore Story became one of the leading artists of an expatriate colony of American sculptors in Rome during the second half of the 19th century. He specialized in portraits of legendarily troubled women who lived lives of political intrigue and psychological and sexual drama, such as Semiramis, the doomed Egyptian queen Cleopatra, and the notorious Greek Medea, who murdered her own children.",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/5321726/,Marble,"Overall: 54 1/2 x 34 1/2 x 65 1/2 in.

Located in the north–central part of the state, Williamsport had an abundance of lumber that gave it more millionaires per capita than any other locale, making it a lucrative market for an enterprising artist such as Severin Roesen, who immigrated to the United States from Germany during the Revolution of 1848.

In the 1930s, he came to know the work of Constantin Brancusi, Jean Arp, and Piet Mondrian. His own works adopted geometric abstraction and a nonobjective vocabulary. Smith was not particularly interested in Mondrian’s theories but responded to the visual impact of his grid and the sense of extension beyond the edge of the canvas.

In fact, Polk Smith never met Mondrian; nonetheless, in 1946 he painted several works in tribute to him, beginning with this work, Homage to Victory Boogie Woogie #1. It is interesting that Smith chose an unfinished Mondrian and one that was begun in New York as the point of departure for his homage. His own work is not confined by any strict rules concerning color and line; rather the floating color planes imply a response to the urban landscape, a dizzying bird’s-eye view, perhaps, from the height of a skyscraper.",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/5322461/,Oil on canvas,Overall: 52 x 48 in.

Every feature is rendered with unusual clarity, from the grass in the foreground to the clouds suspended above the field. Yet the scene appears devoid of any human presence, an absence that underscores the image’s uncanny character.

Cox is associated with regionalism, an American artistic movement that was especially popular during the 1930s. Regionalists usually preferred rural subjects and worked in a naturalistic style. The uncanny quality of Cox’s meticulous style, however, is also exemplary of magic realism, a stylistic tendency that developed in both Europe and America after World War I, though it was never a unified movement. Reacting against the abstract painting that had occurred during the early 20th century, magic realist artists depicted seemingly everyday subjects in a hyper–realistic manner, giving their works an eerie, seemingly magical quality.",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/5323505/,Lithograph,Overall: 9 1/2 x 12 1/4 in.

Stout, a native of Denton, studied at North Texas State University and taught briefly in San Antonio.  He earned a Master's Degree at Columbia University Teacher's College and moved on a permanent basis to New York in 1937.  Until 1950 he split his time between New York and Provincetown, where he then lived year-round.

Stout is best known for his small to moderate-scaled black and white paintings and very small charcoal, conté crayon and graphite drawings, each with astonishingly rich surfaces and deceptively simple forms.  His images are distilled and highly concentrated, elemental shapes or structures.  His process can best be described as meticulous, each work labored over on and off for months or even years.  Stout achieved thereby a powerful sense of density or weight, a tension between form and void, an uncanny spatial ambiguity.

Untitled was painted in the 1950's, years during which Stout studied in the summers at Hans Hofmann's school in Provincetown.  The painting's vibrant color and sense of directional intensity or energy surely reveals Hofmann's impact.  There is a tremendous optical vibration resulting from Stout's careful choice of color, ranging from yellow to pale orange to saturated orange or near red to an uncommon hot pink.  The small blocks of blue amplify the optical vibration and reinforce the sense of upward flow or motion.  Despite the clear influence of Hofmann, Stout seems never to have been tempted by the gestural expressionism of many of his contemporary abstract colleagues.",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/5325525/,Oil on canvas,"Canvas dimensions: 35 3/4 × 17 3/4 in.

In each of these woodcuts, Feininger transforms the original landscape into a dynamic, abstract composition. Hills, clouds, and trees become angular shapes, while straight and diagonal lines add energy and movement. Feininger’s geometric style reflects the influence of expressionism and other abstract movements that flourished in early 20th-century Germany. 

Originally from New York, Feininger spent most of his artistic career in Berlin. He first gained recognition as a cartoonist, but later became a teacher and master printmaker at the Bauhaus, one of the most important schools of design of the 20th century.

Sweden's most successful 18th-century painter, Adolf Ulric Wertmüller trained at the Royal Academy in Stockholm but made his career in France. The changing political climate of the 1790s forced the expatriate painter abroad to Spain and finally to Philadelphia in 1794.

In the 19th century, a sizable prosperous community of free people of color flourished in the city, and many of them worked as artists and craftspeople or ran successful businesses.

The portrait's small scale reflects Hudson's initial training as a miniaturist, while the stark background and precise handling combine the influence of his study in Paris between 1829 and 1831 and his relationship with European artists working in New Orleans in the 1830s, such as Jean-Joseph Vaudechamp and François Fleischbein.",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/5328623/,Oil on canvas,"Framed dimensions: 15 5/8 x 13 1/2 in.

Lee plays off her location's name, combining tangible figures and animals with partially materialized phantoms, witnessed especially by the tiny figure of a ghostly prospector and his pack animal on a ridge in the right background. The bold color relationships of the houses and the simple patterns of the mountains in the background also add to the painting's immediate visual appeal.

At the middle of the 20th century, Lee was one of America's most popular representational artists.

Although born “Franz Josef,” he changed his name to the French “François” to fit in with his Creole clients of Gallic descent.

The portrait effortlessly demonstrates all the qualities that put Alexander in demand. The simplicity of the composition-a solitary seated figure accompanied by a dog-allows for a focus on Miss Roosevelt, whose grace is emphasized by the sweeping brushwork that defines her tall, elegant figure. Yet the oblique gaze and profile view remove this painting from the straightforward depiction of a particular sitter and position it as a study in reverie.

John White Alexander was a truly cosmopolitan painter whose mature career is a synthesis of the major stylistic trends affecting late 19th-century American art. He studied in both Paris and Munich and subsequently became friends with the expatriate American artist James Abbott McNeill Whistler, whose influence may be seen in the mysterious slightly melancholy nature of this portrait. Alexander was also widely acclaimed as a muralist and illustrator.

Besides the characteristic attention paid to Ann Langdon's fashionable dress, her sweetly placid expression and slanted, almond-shaped eyes are also typical devices of the artist, who accentuated his American subjects' features to conform to London standards of fashion. The basket of flowers Mrs. Ayscough carries is a standard prop that alludes to women's beauty and fertility, while the feathery park setting in the background exemplifies the same type of handling Thomas Gainsborough would make famous in England a decade later.

Born in England, John Wollaston's career in the colonies was wide-ranging. Between 1749 and 1767, he painted over 300 portraits during successful residencies in New York, Philadelphia, Maryland, Virginia, the British West Indies, and Charleston.

Once thought to be a portrait of Anthony Rutgers by Pieter Vanderlyn, this painting has recently been firmly reattributed to Gerardus Duyckinck. Based on stylistic analysis, baptismal records, genealogical research, and common sense, the sitter has been re-identified as Anthony's son, Petrus. The portrait shows Petrus Rutgers in an authoritative yet comfortable pose, with one glove casually grasped in his left hand. A hazy landscape can be seen through an opening to his right. The composition is based on that of British mezzotints, a practice shared by numerous colonial painters, from the Duyckincks all the way to John Singleton Copley, often with full cooperation from the sitters.

The Duyckincks were a family of painters and artisans working in New York across four generations. By 1731, at age thirty-six, Gerardus Duyckinck was listed as a freeman of the City of New York (meaning he had finally completed his apprenticeship). In 1735 he advertised in the New-York Weekly Journal:

""Lookin-glasses new Silvered, and the Frames plaine Japan'd or Flowered, also all sorts of Picktures, made and Sold, all manner of painting Work done. Likewise Lookinglasses, and all sorts of 	painting Coullers and Oyl sold at reasonable Rates, by Gerardus Duyckinck at the Sign of the two Cupids, near the Old Slip Market. N.B.Where you may have ready Money for old Lookinglasses""

It is also one of the largest and finest surviving examples of the topographical tradition of American landscape, a school of painting focused on describing the cities and views of the young republic. The businesses and homes along Front, James, and Fulton streets were so clearly identified that a reviewer for the Columbian magazine in May 1820 enthusiastically praised the accuracy of the various compositions (Guy painted at least three similar Brooklyn views):""The stables, barn, and old back buildings of Mr.Titus stand well contrasted with the handsome buildings of Messrs. Sands, Graham, and Birdsall, &c.""

Guy, a London silk-dyer, came to the United States in September 1795 to continue his career in New York and Baltimore. After a 1799 fire destroyed his business, Guy became a full-time painter, despite having no formal artistic training. With the assistance of patrons such as Baltimore's noted early collector Robert Gilmor, who allowed him to copy pictures, Guy developed a charming, distinctive set of views of landmarks around Baltimore. After moving to Brooklyn in 1817, he mounted his most ambitious exhibition, which included this painting, in 1820 at the Shakespeare Club. Sadly, Guy died before the run of the exhibition had finished. William Dunlap, the father of American art history, who met Guy in 1806, wrote dismissively in 1834: ""He attracted some attention by his attempts at landscape painting, and finally made it his profession and found employers. . . . His style was crude and harsh, with little to recommend his efforts, which now would not be tolerated."" Critical opinion, however, has warmed, and today Guy is highly regarded as one of America's earliest and most important landscape artists.",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/5330668/,Oil on canvas,41 x 64 1/2 in.

Hartley's initial high hopes were eventually dashed due to his irritation with commercial tourism and by a drought that blunted the autumnal colors he had expected. By October he wrote that he was ""done in with this incarceration . . . no escape day and night from facing nature constantly . . . and now I am all garbage heap of nerves and weaknesses."" Nevertheless, when exhibited later that year at Alfred Stieglitz's gallery An American Place, Hartley's latest body of work did well due to the deeply lush colors and bold forms that are displayed so triumphantly in this painting.",https://www.dma.org/object/artwork/5330670/,Oil on board,36 x 33 in.

They are actually boys. The cut of the children's shirts and long pants are too masculine to be 19th-century girls' riding habits, although the materials-deep crimson velvet shirts and white trousers-are too costly and fine to have ever been intended for actual use by active boys. The conspicuous elegance of the attire and fanciful hairstyles of these two brothers indicate they are members of a high social class. The opulence of this portrait, the obvious social standing of its subjects, its grandiose scale, and the elaborate carved and gilded frame all suggest that it may in fact be a portrait of the children of a French count that Jean-Joseph Vaudechamp is listed as having exhibited at the Salon of 1842 in Paris.

West Point from Garrisons.  David Johnson. 1870.""",Dallas Museum of Art,2012.6,"Like many of his contemporaries, David Johnson made a close study of the regions surrounding the area of the Hudson River at West Point. In “View from Garrison, West Point, New York, “Johnson lays out below us a panoramic view of the river valley where the United States Military Academy at West Point is at the heart of this topographically accurate composition. Gradual transitions of color from dark to light and between wilderness and settled spaces combine with the driving element of the Hudson River to achieve two results: moving the viewer through the work and striking a harmonic balance between the handiworks of man and the natural wonders of the scene. The artist’s concern for all of the intimate details is an invitation to close observation—from the boats that ply the waters of the Hudson at left, to the train that races southward across the railway viaduct at right. 

Johnson, a leading member of the second generation of Hudson River school painters, executed this work in the distinctive style of his middle career, a period characterized by a tightly controlled brushwork, rich color, and masterful compositional structures. His highly refined technique and sheer application of paint during this period achieve a heightened lucidity and luminosity that finds its closest correspondence in the work of John F. Kensett, who is also represented in this gallery.
